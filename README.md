# Peer-To-Peer-Network (Layer0)

## Parent Project
This is the first part (also called Layer0) of a bigger project.
The goal of the project is to :
  
  1 - Build tools (which are layers of project) that can be used alone, and with any software or programming language.
 
  2 - Combine these tools and inject some fresh and new ideas into these layers (Its the main goal of our implementation)
 
  3 - Build a flexible and easy to code environment to move some centralized services in the world (like insurances or news agencies), to their decentralized form and be pioneer in building the future of Web3.

## About this project

This layer consists of a highly-customizable Peer-To-Peer network which can be used to build your blockchain (or other decentralizing-based projects) on top of it without the need to re-implement this layer yourself each time.

We use Rust lang to implement this layer, because its a high-performance and memory-safe language and it can be compiled to WebAssembly (for our later usage) and Its great support for concurrency.
